Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear John,

I am writing to you from a [2] spaceship in a [3] galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a [4] rocket in [5]. There are [6] baseballs and books of flashlight here! In the
kitchen there is a pool full of coffee. I fall asleep each night on a shiny bed of
steel and dream of reading gently. It feels as though I have lived here for
3 years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
swimming on a magical submarine!!

Best wishes,
Leo
